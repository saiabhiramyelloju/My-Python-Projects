## 📁 Project List

### 1. `Basic Chat bot.py`
A simple rule-based chatbot using `if-else` logic and a response dictionary.  
🧠 Learns: Conditionals, Dictionary usage, Infinite loop.

---

### 2. `BoomBuzz.py`
Prints numbers from 1 to a given input. Replaces:
- Multiples of 7 with "Boom"

- Multiples of both 7 and 11 with "BoomBuzz"  
💥 Learns: Modulus, Looping, Multiple condition checks.

---

### 3. `calcius to farenheit.py`
Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula:  
`F = (C × 9/5) + 32`  
🌡️ Learns: Math operations, Input/Output.

---

### 4. `EvenOddBuzz.py`
Prints:
- "Even" for even numbers  
- "Odd" for odd numbers not divisible by 5  
- "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5  
🤹 Learns: Conditions, `elif` usage, `range()` control.

---

### 5. `farenheit to celcius.py`
Performs the reverse of the above conversion using:  
`C = (F - 32) × 5/9`  
🔥 Learns: Basic formulas and type casting.

---

### 6. `fizzbuzz.py`
A classic coding problem:
- "Fizz" for multiples of 3  
- "Buzz" for multiples of 5  
- "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both  
🎯 Learns: Common coding interview challenge logic.

---

### 7. `FooBarQix.py`
An advanced FizzBuzz variant:
- "Foo" for multiples of 3  
- "Bar" for multiples of 5  
- "Qix" for multiples of 7  
Only one condition gets printed per number.  
💡 Learns: Advanced conditional chaining.

---

### 8. `Hashmap.py`
Takes a student’s name and returns marks using a dictionary (`HashMap`).  
📚 Learns: Dictionary access, `get()` method with default return.

---

### 9. `Leap year Calc.py`
Checks whether a given year is a leap year based on the official rules.  
📆 Learns: Logical operators, edge case handling.

---

### 10. `palindrome checker by python.py`
Reverses a word and checks if it matches the original.  
🪞 Learns: String slicing, Palindrome logic.
