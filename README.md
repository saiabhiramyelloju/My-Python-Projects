## 📁 Project List

### 1. `Basic Chat bot.py`
A simple rule-based chatbot using `if-else` logic and a response dictionary.  
🧠 Learns: Conditionals, Dictionary usage, Infinite loop.

---

### 2. `BoomBuzz.py`
Prints numbers from 1 to a given input. Replaces:
- Multiples of 7 with "Boom"
- Multiples of 11 with "Buzz"
- Multiples of both 7 and 11 with "BoomBuzz"  
💥 Learns: Modulus, Looping, Multiple condition checks.

---

### 3. `calcius to farenheit.py`
Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula:  
`F = (C × 9/5) + 32`  
🌡️ Learns: Math operations, Input/Output.

---

### 4. `EvenOddBuzz.py`
Prints:
- "Even" for even numbers  
- "Odd" for odd numbers not divisible by 5  
- "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5  
🤹 Learns: Conditions, `elif` usage, `range()` control.

---

### 5. `farenheit to celcius.py`
Performs the reverse of the above conversion using:  
`C = (F - 32) × 5/9`  
🔥 Learns: Basic formulas and type casting.

---

### 6. `fizzbuzz.py`
A classic coding problem:
- "Fizz" for multiples of 3  
- "Buzz" for multiples of 5  
- "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both  
🎯 Learns: Common coding interview challenge logic.

---

### 7. `FooBarQix.py`
An advanced FizzBuzz variant:
- "Foo" for multiples of 3  
- "Bar" for multiples of 5  
- "Qix" for multiples of 7  
Only one condition gets printed per number.  
💡 Learns: Advanced conditional chaining.

---

### 8. `Hashmap.py`
Takes a student’s name and returns marks using a dictionary (`HashMap`).  
📚 Learns: Dictionary access, `get()` method with default return.

---

### 9. `Leap year Calc.py`
Checks whether a given year is a leap year based on the official rules.  
📆 Learns: Logical operators, edge case handling.

---

### 10. `palindrome checker by python.py`
Reverses a word and checks if it matches the original.  
🪞 Learns: String slicing, Palindrome logic.

This repository contains three Python programs:

#Password Strength Checker

#PrimeBuzz (incomplete)

#Simple ATM Interface

#Password Strength Checker
File: Password Strength Checker.py

Description
This program evaluates the strength of a user-provided password based on:

Presence of numbers

Presence of special characters

Length of the password

Features
Scores password strength on a point system

Classifies passwords as "Strong", "Medium", or "Low" based on the score

Checks for specific special characters (@, !, #, $, &, *)

Note
The current implementation has some logical issues in the scoring system that need to be fixed.

#PrimeBuzz (Incomplete)
File: PrimeBuzz not completed.py

Description
This is an incomplete program that was intended to:

Identify prime numbers

Print "Quad" for numbers divisible by 4

Print the number itself for other cases

Current Status
The prime number checking logic is incorrect

The program is not fully functional

Needs additional work to complete the intended functionality

#Simple ATM Interface
File: Simple ATM Interface.py

Description
A basic ATM simulation with the following features:

PIN verification (3 attempts allowed)

Balance checking

Withdrawal functionality

Deposit functionality

Features
Secure PIN entry with limited attempts

Real-time balance updates

Simple menu-driven interface

Basic error handling

Usage
Enter the correct PIN (1979)

Select an option from the menu:

1: Check balance

2: Withdraw money

3: Deposit money

Requirements
Python 3.x

How to Run
Execute each program separately using Python:

bash
python [filename].py
Notes
The Password Strength Checker needs logic improvements

PrimeBuzz is incomplete and not functional

The ATM interface uses a hardcoded PIN (1979) and starting balance ($100,000)

## 🛠️ Requirements
Just Python 3. No libraries needed.

---

## 💡 How to Run
Open any `.py` file in your Python IDE or terminal, and follow the on-screen prompts.

```bash
python3 filename.py
